This is Ruby on Rails application for remote monitoring my heating room
("Pannuhuone" in Finnish). The plan is to use Raspberry Pi with MCP3008
and resistive temperature sensors form digital IKEA meat temperature
gauges. Please note that I'm novise. Do not rely on any part of this code.

I'm using Ruby 2.0.0 and Rails 4.0.0. I utilize the code available from
a nice tutorial http://railstutorial.org
